    Settings for the staging environment.
    The settings defined here will *override* the default settings.
    * This file should only define Flask built-in configurations
    (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/#builtin-configuration-values).
    For custom and third-party service configurations, we follow the 12-factor
    apps and define those values in the environment variables.
